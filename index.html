        <h1>About StemBia</h1>
             <p>
           StemBia is an emerging STEM-focused initiative dedicated to applying engineering and artificial intelligence to real-world challenges in The Gambia. Our mission is to research local problem domains—such as healthcare, energy, waste management, and education—and design practical solutions through technology and scientific innovation. <br>

We bring together passionate students from high school to university who have strong interests in mathematics, physics, or computer science. By exposing young people to hands-on problem-solving, we aim to inspire creativity, build technical leadership, and develop the next generation of innovators in The Gambia. <br>

StemBia began as an idea formed from years of community teaching, coding, and research experience by its founder, who has worked across AI education, applied machine learning, and scientific research. Today, StemBia is evolving into a collaborative platform where youth can learn, experiment, and contribute to solutions that improve everyday life in their communities.
